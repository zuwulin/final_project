# GTA Housing Market Price Prediction

### Selected topic
Greater Toronto Area (GTA) housing market prices.

### Reasons for selected topic
We have selected this topic because the Canadian housing market trends have skyrocketed over the past 5 years. In order to understand how the market performs, especially in the GTA area, where the density of the population is extremely big, we would like to discover hidden trends in housing price estimations based on the houses' location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms included, type of dwelling, and previously recorded sale prices.

### Source data acquired for the project
The source data was acquired by our team with the help of a [Pandas scraping tool](https://github.com/maxwellbade/zillow_scrape_python) created by maxwellbade. The source dataset was taken from the current house listings on Zillow, and included a number of features (specifically, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms included, type of dwelling, and previously recorded sale prices) for the market across 5 big cities in the GTA area (i.e., Toronto, Brampton, Mississauga, Vaughan, and Markham). The original dataset collected consisted of 2400 entries, which, upon visual examination, did not appear to have a massive amount of missing data. The data was collected specifically for the purpose of this analysis, thus it should be considered current as of July 13th, 2022.

### Questions hoped to be answered with the data
Based on the input features, we would like to predict the price estimates for other potential houses in the examined GTA area.
Additionally, we would like to examine the following secondary questions:
1. Which home types are the most popular among buyers?
2. What is the geographical distribution of the selling houses currently on the market?
3. What are some of the most prominent correlations amongs the factors that contribute to the house's price?
