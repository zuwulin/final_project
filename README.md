## Selected topic
Greater Toronto Area (GTA) housing market prices.

### Reasons for selected topic
e.g., Canadian housing market have skyrocketed over the past years, leaving most of the low- and middle-class families with barely no chances of acquiring any sort of property (an effect seen for both the renting and buying customers). Because of that, most Canadians the housing market to be extremely innacessible.

### Source data acquired for the project
how?
quality?
size?
recency?
what factors (columns) are we using?

### Questions hoped to be answered with the data
We would like to expore which housing features predict the estimated housing prices, as well as find a continuous pattern in housing location's association with the price, to estimate whether the housing market is, indeed, an innacessible hellscape, or if there is some hope for prospective buyers.

## Communication protocols
Collaborative work meetings during regularly scheduled class time, as well as unrestricted slack messaging and zoom calls on an as-needed basis.

## Machine learning model
what model? supervised regression with decision trees (?)
what features are evaluated?
training/testing split: default 75 /25 ?
accuracy score? confusion matrix results?

## Database
using SQL as storage database

## Dashboard
will most likely use tableau
