### Overview

* The development of a housing price prediction model can assist a house seller, a house buyer or a real estate agent to make better informed decisions based on the house price evaluation.
* The house price study analyzes a dataset composed of almost 2,000 housing advertisements which were collected from a website with current data in July 2022.
* To predict property prices, we will use Linear Regression or Decision Tree model
* Machine learning algorithums: We use supervised learning when we have labelled data which is house price. The machine looks for pattern within value labels to the data points. Then, we are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.
* Prices are to be predicted, then we set label (output) as price column.
* We import another dependency to split our data into train and test using random_state to randomly split data: train data - test data and labels
* We fit our data (train & test) into Linear Regression mode
* Check score to see if it is weak prediction model or a strong one

* we also need to try with other models to make sure that the model we use is the best one with good result.
